# TDM master configuration file
#
# Please note: Settings in this file are sometimes ignored (overridden).
# The default TDM startup script /etc/init.d/tdm looks in /etc/default/tdm.d
# for theme-related settings which, if found, take precedence. The possibly
# overridden settings are: UseBackground, BackgroundCfg, UseTheme, Theme.
# In addition, if a tdmdistrc file is found, this file will be ignored.
# If a tdmdistrc file is installed, changes should be made to that file.
# See /usr/share/doc/tdm/README.Debian for details
#
# Definition: the greeter is the login dialog, i.e., the part of TDM
# which the user sees.
#
# You can configure every X-display individually.
# Every display has a display name, which consists of a host name
# (which is empty for local displays specified in {Static|Reserve}Servers),
# a colon, and a display number. Additionally, a display belongs to a
# display class (which can be ignored in most cases; the control center
# does not support this feature at all).
# Sections with display-specific settings have the formal syntax
# "[X-" host [":" number [ "_" class ]] "-" sub-section "]"
# You can use the "*" wildcard for host, number, and class. You may omit
# trailing components; they are assumed to be "*" then.
# The host part may be a domain specification like ".inf.tu-dresden.de".
# It may also be "+", which means non-empty, i.e. remote displays only.
# From which section a setting is actually taken is determined by these
# rules:
# - an exact match takes precedence over a partial match (for the host part),
#   which in turn takes precedence over a wildcard ("+" taking precedence
#   over "*")
# - precedence decreases from left to right for equally exact matches
# Example: display name "myhost:0", class "dpy".
# [X-myhost:0_dpy] precedes
# [X-myhost:0_*] (same as [X-myhost:0]) precedes
# [X-myhost:*_dpy] precedes
# [X-myhost:*_*] (same as [X-myhost]) precedes
# [X-+:0_dpy] precedes
# [X-*:0_dpy] precedes
# [X-*:0_*] (same as [X-*:0]) precedes
# [X-*:*_*] (same as [X-*])
# These sections do NOT match this display:
# [X-hishost], [X-myhost:0_dec], [X-*:1], [X-:*]
# If a setting is not found in any matching section, the default is used.
#
# Every comment applies to the following section or key. Note that all
# comments will be lost if you change this file with the kcontrol frontend.
# The defaults refer to TDM's built-in values, not anything set in this file.
#
# Special characters need to be backslash-escaped (leading and trailing
# spaces (\s), tab (\t), linefeed (\n), carriage return (\r) and the
# backslash itself (\\)).
# In lists, fields are separated with commas without whitespace in between.
# Some command strings are subject to simplified sh-style word splitting:
# single quotes (') and double quotes (") have the usual meaning; the backslash
# quotes everything (not only special characters). Note that the backslashes
# need to be doubled because of the two levels of quoting.
