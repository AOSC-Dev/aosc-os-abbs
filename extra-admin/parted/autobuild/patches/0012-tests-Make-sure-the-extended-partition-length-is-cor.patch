Subject: [PATCH] tests: Make sure the extended partition length is correct
 (#1135493)

parted tells the kernel the wrong length when reporting a resize of an
extended partition. Make sure the length is 2 for 512b sectors and 1
sector for larger.

(cherry picked from commit 31b5bfa4cd0b2e2944af22466e7b7d88ad94c4c9)
