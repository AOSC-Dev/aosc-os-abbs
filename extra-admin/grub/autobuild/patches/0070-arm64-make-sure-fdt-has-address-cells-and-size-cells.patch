Subject: [PATCH] arm64: make sure fdt has #address-cells and #size-cells
 properties

Recent upstream changes to kexec-tools relies on #address-cells
and #size-cells properties in the FDT. If grub2 needs to create
a chosen node, it is likely because firmware did not provide one.
In that case, set #address-cells and #size-cells properties to
make sure they exist.
