Subject: [PATCH] Fix the looking up grub.cfg-XXX while tftp booting.

Currently, grub doesn't look up grub.cfg-UUID, grub.cfg-MAC and grub.cfg-IP
while the boot is from tftp. That is because the uuid size is got by
grub_snprintf(, 0, ,), but the grub_snprintf() always returns 0,
so grub judges there's no available uuid in the client and give up
the looking up grub.cfg-XXX.

This issue can be fixed by changing grub_snprintf(, 0, ,) behaivior
to like as snprintf() from glibc, however, somewhere may expect
such argument as the error, so it's risky.

Let's use sizeof() and grub_strlen() to calculate the uuid size
instead of grub_snprintf().

Resolves: rhbz#1658500
