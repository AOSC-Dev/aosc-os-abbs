Description: Fix some formatting issues with bc man page
 * Space at end of lines removed
 * Removed or added word space
 * Use "\(en" as a dash to indicate a range instead of "-"
 * Added "\&" after a full stop if it is not an end of sentence
 * Use "\e" to print a backslash
 * Use either macros "IR" or "RI" when mixing these two styles in a row of
   words
 * Use "\," when mixing roman and italic, "\/" for italic and roman.
 * The Word 'funtion' changed to 'function'.
