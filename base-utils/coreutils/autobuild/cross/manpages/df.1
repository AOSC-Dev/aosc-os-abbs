.SH NAME
df \- report file system disk space usage
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B df
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fIFILE\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page
documents the GNU version of
.BR df .
.B df
displays the amount of disk space available on the file system
containing each file name argument.  If no file name is given, the
space available on all currently mounted file systems is shown.  Disk
space is shown in 1K blocks by default, unless the environment
variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, in which case 512-byte blocks are
used.
.PP
If an argument is the absolute file name of a disk device node containing a
mounted file system,
.B df
shows the space available on that file system rather than on the
file system containing the device node.  This version of
.B df
cannot show the space available on unmounted file systems, because on
most kinds of systems doing so requires very nonportable intimate
knowledge of file system structures.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Show information about the file system on which each FILE resides,
or all file systems by default.
.PP
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all\fR
include dummy file systems
.TP
\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-\-block\-size\fR=\fISIZE\fR
scale sizes by SIZE before printing them; e.g.,
\&'\-BM' prints sizes in units of 1,048,576 bytes;
see SIZE format below
.TP
\fB\-\-total\fR
produce a grand total
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-human\-readable\fR
print sizes in powers of 1024 (e.g., 1023M)
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-si\fR
print sizes in powers of 1000 (e.g., 1.1G)
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-inodes\fR
list inode information instead of block usage
.TP
\fB\-k\fR
like \fB\-\-block\-size\fR=\fI1K\fR
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-local\fR
limit listing to local file systems
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-sync\fR
do not invoke sync before getting usage info (default)
.TP
\fB\-\-output\fR[=\fIFIELD_LIST\fR]
use the output format defined by FIELD_LIST,
or print all fields if FIELD_LIST is omitted.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-portability\fR
use the POSIX output format
.TP
\fB\-\-sync\fR
invoke sync before getting usage info
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-type\fR=\fITYPE\fR
limit listing to file systems of type TYPE
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-print\-type\fR
print file system type
.TP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-exclude\-type\fR=\fITYPE\fR
limit listing to file systems not of type TYPE
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
(ignored)
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.PP
Display values are in units of the first available SIZE from \fB\-\-block\-size\fR,
and the DF_BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE and BLOCKSIZE environment variables.
Otherwise, units default to 1024 bytes (or 512 if POSIXLY_CORRECT is set).
.PP
The SIZE argument is an integer and optional unit (example: 10K is 10*1024).
Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y (powers of 1024) or KB,MB,... (powers of 1000).
.PP
FIELD_LIST is a comma\-separated list of columns to be included.  Valid
field names are: 'source', 'fstype', 'itotal', 'iused', 'iavail', 'ipcent',
\&'size', 'used', 'avail', 'pcent', 'file' and 'target' (see info page).
