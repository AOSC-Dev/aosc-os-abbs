A field is a run of blanks (usually spaces and/or TABs), then non\-blank
characters.  Fields are skipped before chars.
.PP
Note: 'uniq' does not detect repeated lines unless they are adjacent.
You may want to sort the input first, or use 'sort \fB\-u\fR' without 'uniq'.
Also, comparisons honor the rules specified by 'LC_COLLATE'.
