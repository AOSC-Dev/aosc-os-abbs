.SH NAME
mktemp \- create a temporary file or directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mktemp
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fITEMPLATE\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Create a temporary file or directory, safely, and print its name.
TEMPLATE must contain at least 3 consecutive 'X's in last component.
If TEMPLATE is not specified, use tmp.XXXXXXXXXX, and \fB\-\-tmpdir\fR is implied.
Files are created u+rw, and directories u+rwx, minus umask restrictions.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-directory\fR
create a directory, not a file
.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
do not create anything; merely print a name (unsafe)
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
suppress diagnostics about file/dir\-creation failure
.TP
\fB\-\-suffix\fR=\fISUFF\fR
append SUFF to TEMPLATE; SUFF must not contain a slash.
This option is implied if TEMPLATE does not end in X
.TP
\fB\-p\fR DIR, \fB\-\-tmpdir\fR[=\fIDIR\fR]
interpret TEMPLATE relative to DIR; if DIR is not
specified, use $TMPDIR if set, else \fI/tmp\fP.  With
this option, TEMPLATE must not be an absolute name;
unlike with \fB\-t\fR, TEMPLATE may contain slashes, but
mktemp creates only the final component
.TP
\fB\-t\fR
interpret TEMPLATE as a single file name component,
relative to a directory: $TMPDIR, if set; else the
directory specified via \fB\-p\fR; else \fI/tmp\fP [deprecated]
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
