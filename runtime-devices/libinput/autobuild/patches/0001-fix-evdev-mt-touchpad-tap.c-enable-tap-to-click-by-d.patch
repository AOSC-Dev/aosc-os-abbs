Subject: [PATCH] fix(evdev-mt-touchpad-tap.c): enable tap-to-click by default

As we know, most touchpads these days come with no buttons *and*, more
importantly, decent palm rejection and tap zones/recognition. The original
patch that disabled this default behavior was built on assumptions from
2014 and may well be accurate, but it would seem a bit bizzare today to
see a click-only default.

KDE 6 has enabled this behaviour by default since a year ago.[^1] What's
more, the GNOME folks have been wondering why they still needed to click
their touchpads (some distributions enables tap-to-click by default but
some others doesn't). A quick search would find us many users confused by
this default behavior.

This is a partial revert of:

    touchpad: hook up to the tapping configuration

    Now that we have run-time changes of the tap.enabled state move the check
    to the IDLE state only. Otherwise the tap machine may hang if tapping is
    disabled while a gesture is in progress.

    Two basic tests are added to check for the tap default setting - which is now
    "tap disabled by default", for two reasons:
    * if you don't know that tapping is a thing (or enabled by default), you get
      spurious button events that make the desktop feel buggy.
    * if you do know what tapping is and you want it, you usually know where to
      enable it, or at least you can search for it.
