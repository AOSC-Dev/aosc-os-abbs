+If you have been using setserial versions 2.15-1 to 2.15-6, and you have
+been having problems with setserial taking over your pcmcia serial/modem
+devices, then read on... Otherwise stop reading now, as NONE OF THIS APPLIES
+TO YOU.
+
+At of 2.15-1, setserial searches for serial device configuration on
+shutdown or halt, and stores it in /etc/serial.conf. The state is
+then automatically loaded on a reboot. This includes pcmcia devices,
+which are not managed by setserial but by pcmcia-cs.
+
+As of 2.15-7, setserial does not save the state of pcmcia devices. If you
+really do want it to control pcmcia ports, you will have to switch off
+the AUTOSAVE ability, and do it by hand.
+
+However, if you used 2.15-1 to 2.15-6, the pcmcia devices will already be
+in /etc/serial.conf, and although setserial tries to sort out the problem
+automatically when you upgrade, you may feel you want to do some tidying up...
+
+(1) make sure that your pcmcia cards are inserted and configured.
+(2) su root
+(3) /etc/init.d/setserial stop
+    hopefully, some messages will appear informing you that pcmcia filtering
+    is going on.
+(4) Look in your /etc/serial.conf. A two-port standard setup should look
+    something like:
+
+###AUTOSAVE###
+/dev/ttyS0 uart 16550A port 0x03f8 irq 4 spd_normal skip_test session_lockout
+/dev/ttyS1 uart 16550A port 0x02f8 irq 3 spd_normal skip_test session_lockout
+
+    If you have only one non-pcmcia port, then you should have only
+    /dev/ttyS0. Most desktop computers have two ports.
+(5) If you see a device (eg /dev/ttyS2) which is not one of your non-pcmcia
+    serial ports, run "setserial /dev/ttyS2 uart unknown" to delete it. Do
+    not bother to edit the serial.conf file. Instead, run 
+    /etc/init.d/setserial stop
+    Check the file. If everything is ok, you can try a 
+    /etc/init.d/setserial start
+    No error messages - you are in the clear.
+
+Sorry for the problems caused by earlier versions
