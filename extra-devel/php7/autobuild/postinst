==================================================

PHP7, or PHPng is the next generation of PHP for Web applications.
Although this package remained in the same package name, it does
not mean that PHP7 is fully backwards compatible with your old
PHP 5.x installation.

For information on necessary changes in your application for
compatibility, please consult this PHP7 migration documentation:

http://php.net/manual/en/migration70.incompatible.php

Additional attention is needed on Apache modules configuration.

/etc/httpd/conf/extra/

contains the Apache HTTPD modules configuration. We have shipped
configuration for both PHP5 and PHP7. Please review your
configuration files installed for migration.

For PHP5, please install package php5 or php.
