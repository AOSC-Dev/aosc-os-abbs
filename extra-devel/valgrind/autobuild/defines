# Filter out some flags that cause lots of valgrind test failures.
# Also filter away -O2, valgrind adds it wherever suitable, but
# not for tests which should be -O0, as they aren't meant to be
# compiled with -O2 unless explicitely requested. Same for any -mcpu flag.
# Ideally we will change this to only be done for the non-primary build
# and the test suite.
