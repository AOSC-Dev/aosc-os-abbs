Subject: [Qemu-devel] [PATCH v4 4/4] seccomp: set the seccomp filter to all threads
Date: Wed, 22 Aug 2018 19:02:50 +0200

When using "-seccomp on", the seccomp policy is only applied to the
main thread, the vcpu worker thread and other worker threads created
after seccomp policy is applied; the seccomp policy is not applied to
e.g. the RCU thread because it is created before the seccomp policy is
applied and SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_TSYNC isn't used.

This can be verified with
for task in /proc/`pidof qemu`/task/*; do cat $task/status | grep Secc ; done
Seccomp:        2
Seccomp:        0
Seccomp:        0
Seccomp:        2
Seccomp:        2
Seccomp:        2

Starting with libseccomp 2.2.0 and kernel >= 3.17, we can use
seccomp_attr_set(ctx, > SCMP_FLTATR_CTL_TSYNC, 1) to update the policy
on all threads.

libseccomp requirement was bumped to 2.2.0 in previous patch.
libseccomp should fail to set the filter if it can't honour
SCMP_FLTATR_CTL_TSYNC (untested), and thus -sandbox will now fail on
kernel < 3.17.
