    <p>
      An Open Source vector graphics editor, with capabilities similar to Illustrator,
      CorelDraw, or Xara X, using the W3C standard Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file
      format.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inkscape supports many advanced SVG features (markers, clones, alpha blending,
      etc.) and great care is taken in designing a streamlined interface. It is very
      easy to edit nodes, perform complex path operations, trace bitmaps and much more.
      We also aim to maintain a thriving user and developer community by using open,
      community-oriented development.
